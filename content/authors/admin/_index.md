#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm Anne Baranger, and I am currently in the final year of my PhD at the National Institute for Agronomic and Environmental Research, in Grenoble, France, under the supervision of Dr. Kunstler and Dr. Cordonnier. In my work, I investigate the vulnerability of forests to climate change bringing together different modelling approaches from biogeography, functional ecology, ecophysiology and demography.
